## Data types

Here you can find a data types that used in mangadex-downloader path placeholders

### string

It's a text.

The string type data follows python f-string (formatted string). 
You can read more about it [in here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language)

### integer

It's a negative or positive number

### array

It's a list of data, 
you can access a data by giving index position.

```{note}
You may see additional data type inside of a bracket

Like this one: `array[string]`

This means inside the array is an list of strings.
```

For example:

```shell
# Let's say you want to get alternative title
# You can do this by accessing `alternative_titles` in manga placeholder
# This will get alternative title in position 0 of an list
mangadex-dl "URL" --path "/home/mymanga/{manga.alternative_titles[0]}"
```

### ArrayModified

Same as `array` data type, but it has additional attributes

- first
- last

These attributes is equals to accessing array with index `0` or `-1`.

Let me give you an example:

```shell
# Doing this
mangadex-dl "URL" --filename-volume "Vol. {volume} (Ch. {volume.chapters.first.chapter} - Ch. {volume.chapters.last.chapter})"

# Is equal to
mangadex-dl "URL" --filename-volume "Vol. {volume} (Ch. {volume.chapters[0].chapter} - Ch. {volume.chapters[-1].chapter})"
